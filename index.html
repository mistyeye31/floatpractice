            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

            <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

            <p>Capybaras are the largest living rodent. The family Caviidae includes the species Hydrochoerus
                hydrochaeris (common capybara) and Hydrochoerus isthmius (lesser capybara). According to the
                Guarani Indians, the name capybara (pronounced "kapibar'u”) means the "master of the grasses"
                (Montiani-Ferreira, 2008). Capybaras have a combined head and body length of 100–130 cm (39–51 in.),
                with a shoulder height as tall as 50 cm (20 in.) and a body weight that can range from 27–79 kg (60–174
                lb.). The average weight of managed capybaras is 50 kg (110 lb.) for adult males and 61 kg (135 lb.) for
                adult females. The lesser capybara is smaller than the common capybara in all external and cranial
                measurements, weighing an average of 28 kg (62 lb.). The lesser capybara exhibits thicker and wider
                frontal bones, shorter and thicker pterygoids, and a longer diastema. The diploid number of H. isthmius is
                2n=64 (FN=104) which differs from H. hydrochaeris whose diploid number is 2n=66 (FN=102). Sexual
                maturity occurs at 12–18 months of age in both H. hydrochaeris and H. isthmius, with the length of
                gestation varying between 150 days (H. hydrochaeris) and 108 days (H. isthmius) (Moreira et al., 2013).
                The average lifespan in their natural environment is 4 years; however, they may live up to 10 years
                (Macdonald, 2006).
